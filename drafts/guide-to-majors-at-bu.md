# Guide to Majors at BU

## About

I started this project as a way of learning about all the programs and departments at BU. I wanted to develop an easy way to click through the options for majors so I could share the information with students and be conversant in the basics of each program.

Information about programs has been adapted from the [BU Academic Calendar](http://brandonu.ca/calendar) or departmental websites on the [BU website](http://brandonu.ca/).

### Anthropology

**Website**: https://www.brandonu.ca/anthropology/

**About**

The Anthropology program at Brandon University encompasses three of the discipline’s four traditional major sub-fields: socio-cultural
anthropology, archaeology and biological anthropology. Students in the Anthropology program are required to take some courses in each
area, to introduce the student to the whole field of anthropology. This emphasizes the holistic theory behind these ways of studying human development and culture.

All students pursuing a major, minor or honours degree in Anthropology are required to complete 12:153 Introduction to Socio-cultural
Anthropology and 12:173 Introduction to Archaeology and Biological Anthropology. Students should consult the Anthropology Degree Planner
for more information and to determine which program best suits their interests and career goals. It is available through the Anthropology departmental webpage https://www.brandonu.ca/anthropology/.
